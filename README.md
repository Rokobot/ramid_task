## **Task 1: Basic Data Types (Easy)**

**Objective:**  
Learn to use Dart’s basic data types.

**Instructions:**
1. Create the following variables:
   - `name` → a string  
   - `age` → an integer  
   - `height` → a double  
   - `isStudent` → a boolean  
2. Print a full sentence that includes all the variables.

**Example Output:**
My name is Ali. I am 20 years old, 1.75 meters tall, and I am a student: true.

## **Task 2: Working with Lists (Moderate)**

**Objective:**  
Understand how to create and modify a list.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a `List<String>` named `cities` with at least five city names.  
2. Add one new city to the list.

4. Print the updated list and its length.

**Example Output:**

## **Task 3: Using Sets (Intermediate)**

**Objective:**  
Learn how Sets store only unique values.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a `Set<int>` called `numbers` with repeated values, such as `{2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 8}`.  
2. Print the set to show that duplicates are removed.  
3. Add a new number to the set.  
4. Check if the number `6` exists in the set and print the result.

**Example Output:**
Numbers: {2, 4, 6, 8}
Contains 6: true

## **Task 4: Working with Maps (Hard)**

**Objective:**  
Practice storing and accessing key–value pairs.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a `Map<String, double>` named `studentScores`, where each key is a student’s name and each value is their score.  
2. Add at least one new student and score.  
3. Print all student names and their scores in a clear format.  
4. Calculate and print the average score of all students.

**Example Output:**
Student Scores:
Ali: 85.5
